          <p>
            First, the different nature of retail credit risk and commercial credit risk is introduced, and the main issues in credit risk assessment are highlighted.
            Second, we'll look at the process of credit scoring in more detail. Credit scoring is now a widely used technique, not only in the banking industry, but also in many other industries where there is a need to check a customer's credit status or estimate the likelihood of a customer making a claim.
            Finally, we will discuss innovations in retail banking and advancements in retail credit risk, including the use of big data and machine learning to better assess risk, and raise regulatory questions.

            Digital health is a convergence of technologies designed to improve healthcare delivery and outcomes, engage patients, expand evidence-based research, create and mine new data sources, and support positive health behaviors. These are applied through hardware, software, and analytics-enabled solutions that can be delivered virtually over the internet or other means of transmission.
            Digital health has quickly become a multidisciplinary field, involving healthcare providers, behavioral psychologists, data scientists, technologists, implementing scientists, engineers, designers, social scientists, and participants from the disciplines of public health, health economics, and healthcare administration.
